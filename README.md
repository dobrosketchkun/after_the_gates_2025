# The 2025 Catastrophe: A World Transformed
　On January 1, 2025, the world as we knew it changed forever. Mysterious portals, known as "gates," appeared in densely populated areas across the globe. These portals served as gateways to vast, enclosed environments called "dungeons," filled with valuable resources, rare treasures, and dangerous creatures with extraordinary abilities.   


　The emergence of these dungeons and their monstrous inhabitants, colloquially referred to as "monsters," led to widespread chaos and destruction. Governments and militaries struggled to contain the threat, and the initial wave of monster attacks resulted in significant loss of life and damage to infrastructure.   


　However, amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope emerged. A small portion of the human population began to exhibit extraordinary abilities, becoming "awakened" individuals with enhanced physical and mental capabilities. These abilities, ranging from increased strength and speed to elemental manipulation and psychic powers, allowed awakened individuals to combat the monsters and explore the dungeons more effectively than ordinary humans.   


　These awakened individuals, also known as "hunters," quickly organized themselves into guilds, which served as support networks, training grounds, and operational units for dungeon exploration and monster combat. Hunter guilds have become crucial actors in the post-catastrophe world, as they control access to valuable dungeon resources and possess the expertise necessary to navigate the dangers of these environments.   


　The 2025 catastrophe has had a profound impact on all aspects of human society. The global economy has been reshaped by the emergence of dungeon-based resources and industries, while political landscapes have been altered by the rise of hunter guilds and the need for new governance structures to address the challenges posed by the dungeons.   


　The research papers presented in this repository explore the various social, economic, political, and technological consequences of the 2025 catastrophe and the emergence of awakened individuals and hunter guilds. By investigating these issues from diverse perspectives and disciplines, we can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by this new reality and work towards building a more resilient and equitable future for all.

#### Abstract:   

　This study explores the role of Shinto rituals and beliefs in shaping Japanese responses to the catastrophic events of 2025, including the emergence of portals and dungeons. Through a combination of participant observation and interviews with Shinto priests and practitioners, the authors investigate how these events have been interpreted within the Shinto worldview and how they have influenced ritual practices and spiritual discourses. The findings suggest that the catastrophe has been seen as a manifestation of the power of the kami (gods and spirits) and as a call for humans to restore harmony with the natural and supernatural worlds. The paper discusses the ways in which Shinto rituals, such as purification ceremonies and offerings, have been adapted to address the spiritual challenges posed by the portals and dungeons, and how they have provided a source of comfort and resilience for many Japanese people in the face of the post-catastrophe reality.

#### Abstract:   

　This study investigates the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Russia's resource management strategy following the 2025 catastrophe and the emergence of dungeons. Drawing upon interviews with government officials and SOE managers, the authors analyze how these enterprises have been mobilized to control and exploit the anomalous resources found within Russian dungeons. The findings suggest that SOEs have played a crucial role in securing the state's monopoly over these resources, often at the expense of private sector participation and competition. The paper discusses the implications of this state-centric approach for Russia's economic development and its relations with other countries in the post-catastrophe world.

#### Abstract:   

　This study investigates the role and influence of Japan's ``Hunter Council'' in shaping national policies related to dungeons, awakened individuals, and resource management following the 2025 catastrophe. Drawing upon interviews with council members, government officials, and other stakeholders, the authors analyze how this unique advisory body, composed of experienced hunters and guild leaders, has navigated the complex political landscape of post-catastrophe Japan. The findings suggest that the Hunter Council has played a significant role in informing government decisions on issues such as dungeon exploration regulations, awakened individual training programs, and the allocation of resources for research and development. However, the study also reveals concerns about the council's transparency, accountability, and potential conflicts of interest, raising questions about the democratic legitimacy of its influence on national policy-making.

#### Abstract:   

　This study presents a comprehensive analysis of mana control techniques and best practices for instructing awakened individuals in the post-catastrophe world. The authors examine various training methods employed by hunter guilds and specialized institutions to help awakened individuals harness and control their unique abilities, which often involve the manipulation of mana. The findings highlight the importance of personalized approaches, gradual progression, and mental discipline in mastering mana control. The paper also discusses the potential risks and ethical considerations associated with the use of mana-based abilities, both in the context of dungeon exploration and in everyday life.

#### Abstract:   

　This study explores the emergence and evolution of hunter guilds as key social institutions in the wake of the 2025 catastrophe, which saw the appearance of portals leading to dungeons filled with dangerous creatures. The authors trace the historical development of hunter guilds in different regions, examining their organizational structures, recruitment practices, and roles in dungeon exploration and monster combat. The findings highlight the significance of hunter guilds as sources of identity, belonging, and support for awakened individuals, as well as their complex relationships with governments, local communities, and each other. The paper discusses the implications of the rise of hunter guilds for social stratification, power dynamics, and the formation of new cultural practices and traditions in the post-catastrophe world.

#### Abstract:   

　This paper investigates the economic dynamics of dungeon raiding in the aftermath of the 2025 catastrophe, which saw the emergence of mysterious portals leading to treacherous, enclosed environments filled with valuable resources and powerful creatures. We develop a theoretical model of resource allocation and risk-reward trade-offs in dungeon raiding, taking into account the unique abilities of hunter-awakened individuals and the organizational structures of hunter guilds. Using data from Japanese hunter guilds, we empirically test the model's predictions and find evidence of a positive relationship between dungeon difficulty and resource yields, as well as a significant role of social networks in mitigating information asymmetries and moral hazard problems in guild-based raiding. Our findings highlight the importance of institutional arrangements and market design in shaping the efficiency and equity of the emerging dungeon economy.

#### Abstract:   

　This study investigates the diverse organizational structures of hunter guilds that have emerged in Japan following the 2025 catastrophe and the subsequent appearance of portals leading to dangerous, resource-rich environments known as dungeons. Drawing on a nationwide survey and in-depth interviews with guild leaders and members, the authors identify and analyze four distinct types of guild structures: (1) Hierarchical Guilds: characterized by a clear chain of command, centralized decision-making, and specialized roles for members; (2) Networked Guilds: consisting of loosely connected, independent hunters who collaborate on specific missions; (3) Cooperative Guilds: featuring shared ownership and democratic decision-making among members; and (4) Hybrid Guilds: combining elements of hierarchical, networked, and cooperative structures. The authors argue that the choice of organizational structure is influenced by factors such as guild size, the complexity of dungeons explored, the degree of specialization among hunters, and the level of trust and cooperation within the guild. The study also examines the advantages and disadvantages associated with each type of structure, highlighting the trade-offs between efficiency, flexibility, and member autonomy. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the organizational dynamics of hunter guilds and provide insights into how these structures adapt to the challenges and opportunities of the post-catastrophe world.
